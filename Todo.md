# Quick TODO Note storage. more in issues
- move device logic to dedicated js lib
- lint / pretty config ...
- "hashUnit" support (f.e. 1 gpu, ...)
- remaining code todos

## Current
- also disable mac (and ip?) input in settings device form: would duplicate the device. changing mac doesn't make sense ... can just create a new device anyway if really needed
- dm improvements: 
  - details
  - validators ...
  - only show relevant fields
  - form: tooltips, placeholders, labels, explanations
- connected status
- "raw" miner stats state (user can self parse - before "features" implemented)
- 'Method not implemented.' ...
- logs everywhere
